# Monogram shop replica

To practice a little more with tailwind and a little bit with javascript I tried to replicate the monogram shop:

[Original site](https://monogramcc.com/shop/)
[Replica](https://monogram-shop-replica.vercel.app/)

The proportions don't quite add up but I'm much more confident with tailwind now. You can see a lot of repeated elements and I plan to learn something
to handle that in the future, since copy pasting multiple elements is functional only for very small and simple segments, but it's hell for 
mainentance. I put the most amount of effort on having the website look and scale good, with a mobile-first approach.
The parts I already knew how to do, like the side menu and structuring I'm really satisfied with, but since I'm not savy enough with javascript yet I
had to some small changes to have different components distinguished.
On the javascript note, the simple stuff went pretty smooth, but I tried to challenge myself using an API to change the products' prices through the
user interface, by selecting a different currency. The implementation is not perfect but I learned a lot with it, the most difficult part was 
importing the library, in fact despite working on the live server it doesn't work anymore locally for me, I should really learn typescript better, so
I can start looking into libraries
